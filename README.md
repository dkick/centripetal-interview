Bonus Points: Use polylith

Polylith is something that I meant to get around to using some day but
I haven't had the chance. This seems like a good opportunity.

"If you read any articles or take any tips from any site, tutorial, or
blog, Cite them . Put them in a Readme.md or references.txt file to
show what research you did."

Polylith has some [great
documentation](https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith). And some
excellent, very relevant examples:
